# Are you the San Francisco restaurant critic?

I wish! I get asked that a lot, and occasionally I get a
really good table. [The food critic Michael
Bauer](http://www.sfchronicle.com/author/michael-bauer/) works for the San
Francisco Chronicle and writes really great restaurant reviews, which you can

# Karate

[Shotokan Karate of America](http://ska.org/) is the oldest karate organization
in the United States. At the [San Francisco Dojo](http://sf.ska.org/), located
in Haight-Ashbury, we are dedicated to teaching and studying Shotokan Karate in
the traditional Japanese manner, following the teachings of Master [Gichin
Funakoshi](http://ska.org/about/master-funakoshi/) and [Tsutomu
Ohshima](http://ska.org/about/tsutomu-ohshima/), Shihan (head instructor) of
SKA. I am one of the instructors and the dojo manager. Come visit!

# My wife

Amy is a public health epidemiologist and currently an Assistant Professor at
UCSF School of Medicine. [Her
research](http://profiles.ucsf.edu/amy.padula) focuses on the environmental
effects on birth outcomes and is absolutely fascinating.
