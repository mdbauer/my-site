Welcome to my website! I'm a Professor of Financial Economics at [Unitersität
Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/), a research fellow of the [CESifo Research
Network](https://www.cesifo.org/), and a member of the [Macro Finance
Society](https://macrofinancesociety.org/). I recently moved back to Germany, my
home country. Previously I had been working as an economist at the [Federal Reserve Bank
of San Francisco](https://frbsf.org/) since 2010.

My research focuses on the interactions of financial markets with the
macroeconomy and monetary policy. I am particularly interested in trying to
understand the effects of monetary policy actions on financial markets, the
determinants of long-term interest rates, macro-financial linkages more
generally, and, more recently, the role of financial markets for climate
change. My work has been published in leading economics journals including the
*American Economic Review*, the *Review of Financial Studies*, and the *Journal
of Business and Economic Statistics*.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of California, San
Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu/), where [Jim
Hamilton](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilton/) was my doctoral adviser, and my
B.A. in Economics and [M.A. in Quantitative Economics and Finance](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/master/quantitativeeconomicsandfinance/) from the
[University of St. Gallen,
Switzerland](https://www.unisg.ch/).
