Welcome to my website! I'm a Research Advisor in the Economic Research
Department of the [Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco](https://www.frbsf.org). My research focuses on the interactions of
financial markets with the macroeconomy and monetary policy. I am particularly
interested in trying to understand the effects of monetary policy actions on
financial markets, including the unconventional policies that central banks
started implementing during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, like asset
purchases and forward guidance. My work has been published in leading
economics journals including the *American Economic Review*, the *Review of
Financial Studies*, and the *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of California, San
Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu/), where [Jim
Hamilton](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilton/) was my doctoral adviser, and my
B.A. in Economics and M.A. in Quantitative Economics and Finance from the
[University of St. Gallen,
Switzerland](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/master/quantitativeeconomicsandfinance).
