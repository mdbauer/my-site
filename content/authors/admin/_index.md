Michael Bauer is a Research Advisor in the Economic Research Department of the
[Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco](https://www.frbsf.org). His research interests are in financial
economics, macro/monetary economics, and time series econometrics, with a focus
on the interactions of financial markets with the macroeconomy and monetary
policy.  One area of Michaelâ€™s work is trying to understand the financial market
effects of monetary policy, such as the unconventional monetary policies --
asset purchases and forward guidance -- that central banks implemented during
and after the global financial crisis of 2008. Michael has published in leading
economics journals including the *American Economic Review*, the *Review of
Financial Studies*, and the *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*.

Michael obtained his Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of California, San
Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu/), with [James
Hamilton](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilton/) as his doctoral adviser, and his
B.A. in Economics and M.A. in Quantitative Economics and Finance from the
[University of St. Gallen,
Switzerland](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/master/quantitativeeconomicsandfinance).
