# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract: "Conditional yield skewness is an important summary statistic of the state of the
economy. It exhibits pronounced variation over the business cycle and with the
stance of monetary policy, and a tight relationship with the slope of the yield
curve.  Most importantly, variation in yield skewness has substantial
forecasting power for future bond excess returns, high-frequency interest rate
changes around FOMC announcements, and consensus survey forecast errors for the
ten-year Treasury yield. The COVID pandemic did not disrupt these relations:
historically high skewness correctly anticipated the run-up in long-term Treasury yields
starting in late 2020. The connection between skewness, survey forecast errors,
excess returns, and departures of yields from normality is consistent with a
theoretical framework where one of the agents has biased beliefs."
