abstract: "An extensive literature studies the impact of monetary policy surprises---shifts in expected policy rates---on asset prices. This paper addresses the open question of how shifts in the uncertainty about future policy  rates matter for the transmission of monetary policy to financial markets. To  this end, we develop a novel measure of policy uncertainty based on derivative  prices that can be used in event studies. We provide evidence for an FOMC  uncertainty cycle, the systematic pattern of resolution of uncertainty on FOMC  announcement days followed by a gradual ramp-up over the next two  weeks. Furthermore, specific monetary policy actions have differential effects  on uncertainty, with the most substantial shifts due to changes in the forward  guidance provided by the FOMC. Changes in uncertainty have pronounced effects  on asset prices, distinct from the effects of changes in expected policy  rates. Moreover, the prevailing level of uncertainty determines the  effectiveness of policy surprises: When uncertainty is low, monetary policy surprises have stronger effects on asset prices."
