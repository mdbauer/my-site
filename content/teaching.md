## PHDBA 239C Empirical Asset Pricing at Berkeley Haas, Fall 2018

In Fall 2018 [Martin Lettau](https://sites.google.com/view/martinlettau/home)
and I jointly taught the 2nd year Ph.D. course "Empirical Asset Pricing" at
[Berkeley Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/). Martin taught
the first half with a focus on the predictability of stock returns and
cross-sectional asset pricing. I taught the second half which focused on the
term structure of interest rates, and in addition covered the term structure of
equity risk premia and currency risk premia.
