<p><a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/thomas-mertens/">Thomas</a> and
I wrote a second Economic Letter about the information in the yield curve for
predicting recessions. Here we focus on what different measure of the shape of
the yield curve—that is, which yield spread—appears to have the most
information. We conclude that the classic 10-year minus 3-month spread is the
most useful one. We also discuss the role of the term premium, and how to
interpret this evidence. (Correlation is not causation!)</p>
