<p>Why have long-term interest rates been falling throughout much of 2017, while the Federal Reserve has been normalizing monetary policy? At first sight, the combination of rising short rates and falling long rates seems puzzling, and even vaguely reminiscent of the famous <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/greenspans-conundrum-114799">Greenspan conundrum</a>.
