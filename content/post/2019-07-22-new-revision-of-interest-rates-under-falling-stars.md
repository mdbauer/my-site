[Glenn Rudebusch](http://glennrudebusch.com/) and I finished another round of
revisions of our paper "Interest Rates Under Falling Stars" which we just sent
back to the *American Economics Revies*. This version includes a lot more
details about our novel yield-curve model with a time-varying trend. 

We will make the complete data and code available once the paper is published.
