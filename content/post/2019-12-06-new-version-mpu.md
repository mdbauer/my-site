We substantially revised our working paper "Market-Based Monetary Policy Uncertainty"
and posted the new version online. The new version of the paper, which is coauthored with [Aeimit
Lakdawala](https://aeimit.weebly.com/) and [Philippe
Mueller](https://sites.google.com/site/philippebmueller/), not only includes
several new results, but in addition features a simple model for the short-term
interest rate with jumps around FOMC announcements, which is helpful for
interpreting our empirical findings on the resolution of uncertainty and the
FOMC uncertainty cycle. The updated paper is [available
here](/publication/monetary-policy-uncertainty). 

If you are interested in using our market-based measure of monetary policy
uncertainty in your own work, just email me and I'll send it to you. 

I will be presenting the paper at the ASSA meetings in San Diego in January, in
the [session on "Financial Markets and Monetary Policy" of the Econometric
Society on Saturday, January 4](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2020/preliminary/2120?q=eNqrVipOLS7OzM8LqSxIVbKqhnGVrJQMlWp1lBKLi_OTgRwlHaWS1KJcXCArKbE0tQjITUmshIpn5qZCWGWZqeUgM4oKCoACpgZKtbVcMN2CHWc).
