[Glenn Rudebusch](http://glennrudebusch.com/) and I finished a new version of
our paper "Interest Rates Under Falling Stars" which includes a lot of new
material. Among other things we included various new estimates of the equilibrium real interest
rate, $r^\ast$, and we developed a new model for the yield curve that allows for
shifting long-run trends and provides a Bayesian estimate of the equilibrium
nominal interest rate $i^\ast$.
