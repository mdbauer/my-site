[Mike Chernov](https://sites.google.com/site/mbchernov/)
and I have written a paper on the information content in option-implied
skewness. We find that conditional skewness is closely related to financial
conditions and monetary policy, but contains substantial additional predictive
power for future interest rates, bond returns, and survey forecast errors. Our
findings can be rationalized in a simple model with biased beliefs. 

The paper is [available here](/publication/skewness).
