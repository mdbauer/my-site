[Glenn
Rudebusch](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/glenn-rudebusch/)
and I have written a paper that takes a macro-finance perspective of social
discount rates. Our main point is that the secular decline in the equilibrium
real interest rate has lowered all discount rates and boosted the present value
of future damages from climate change. 

The paper is [available here](/publication/dr).
