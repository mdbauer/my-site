[Eric Swanson](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~swanson2/index.html) and I have
written a new paper where we question the evidence for the "Fed information
effect" documented in the recent macro-finance literature. We propose an
alternative channel that explains the available evidence, namely that the Fed
simply responds to publicly available economic news. We call it the "Fed
response to news" channel and present strong new evidence in favor of this
channel and against the "Fed information effect." The paper is [available
here](/publication/fed-info).
