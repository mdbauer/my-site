[Thomas](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/thomas-mertens/) and
I wrote a second Economic Letter about the information in the yield curve for
predicting recessions. Here we focus on what different measure of the shape of
the yield curve---that is, which yield spread---appears to have the most
information. We conclude that the classic 10-year minus 3-month spread is the
most useful one. We also discuss the role of the term premium, and how to
interpret this evidence. (Correlation is not causation!)
