summary: "My research with Eric Swanson questions the 'Fed information effect' story and proposes an alternative explanation of puzzling recent findings: both the Fed and professional forecasters respond to public macro news."
abstract: "High-frequency changes in interest rates around FOMC announcements are a standard
    method of measuring monetary policy shocks.  However, some recent authors have found that these shocks have
    puzzling effects on private-sector forecasts of inflation, unemployment, or real GDP that is opposite in sign
    to what standard macroeconomic models would predict; they argue this is evidence of a 'Fed information
    effect' channel of monetary policy, whereby an FOMC tightening (easing) communicates that the economy is
    stronger (weaker) than the public had expected.  We show that these empirical results are also consistent with
    a 'Fed response to news' channel, in which incoming, publicly available economic news causes *both* the
    Fed to change monetary policy *and* the private sector to revise its forecasts.  We provide substantial
    new evidence that distinguishes between these two channels and strongly favors the latter; for example,
    (i) high-frequency stock market responses to Fed announcements, (ii) a new survey that we conduct of individual
    Blue Chip forecasters, and (iii) regressions that include the previously omitted public macroeconomic data
    releases all indicate that the Fed and forecasters are simply responding to the same public news, and that
    there is little if any role for a 'Fed information effect'."
