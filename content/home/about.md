# Bio

Michael Bauer is a Research Advisor in the Economic
Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. His 
research interests are in financial economics, macro/monetary economics, and
time series econometrics, with a focus on the
interactions of financial markets with the macroeconomy and monetary
policy.  One area of Michaelâ€™s work is trying to understand the financial market effects of monetary
policy, such as the unconventional monetary policies -- asset purchases and
forward guidance -- that central banks implemented during and after the global
financial crisis of 2008. Michael has published in leading economics journals including the *American
Economic Review*, the *Review of Financial Studies*, and the *Journal of
Business and Economic Statistics*.

Michael obtained his Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of California, San
Diego](https://economics.ucsd.edu/), with [James
Hamilton](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilton/) as his doctoral adviser, and his
B.A. in Economics and M.A. in Quantitative Economics and Finance from the
[University of St. Gallen,
Switzerland](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/master/quantitativeeconomicsandfinance).
